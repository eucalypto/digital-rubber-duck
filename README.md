# Not a Rubber Duck
A project to build a more interactive (aka digital) rubber duck for Rubber Duck Problem Solving

Everyone knows that explaining your problem to someone else often leads to you finding the solution on your own. I know of many instances where I "helped" other people that way by simply listening to them, asking questions, and waiting for them to come up with the solution.

You could buy a cheap rubber duck and talk to it. Indeed, you coud do that, but who wants to seem crazy talking to a rubber duck? Not you! You want to type your thoughts into a small electronic device. A device that has a big advantage to a rubber duck: it can give feedback.

In particular, it can be more interactive and ask you a set of questions.

Woebot is a chatbot that improves your mental health and teaches you techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy. It's amazing how helpful such a "machine" can be.
